Copyright (c) 1996-2010 Carnegie Mellon University and Alexander I. Rudnicky

The model is in standard ARPA format, designed by Doug Paul while he was at MITRE.

The code that was used to produce this language model is available in Open Source.

The (fixed) discount mass is 0.5. The backoffs are computed using the ratio method.
This model based on a corpus of 79 sentences and 31 words
